# Evaluation-of-Frame-Transmission-Reliability-in-Automotive-Networks-Using-Enumeration-Approach

# Automotive Network Reliability Analysis

This project evaluates the end-to-end frame transmission reliability in various automotive network architectures using an enumeration approach. It considers different network configurations and bit error rates (BERs) to determine the likelihood of successful frame transmission, packet loss rates, and the average time between packet losses.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
python3 -m pip install decimal itertools
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the main Python script.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
